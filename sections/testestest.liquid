    <p>
      <span
        >Thanks to the high versatility of carbon fiber, Urtopia offers a sleek and modern aesthetic, appealing to those looking for a stylish and agile ride, whether for city commuting, leisure, or trail riding. On the other hand, Trek uses a more traditional frame design. The aluminum material used in Trek's frame adds noticeable bulk. While aesthetics are subjective, the Carbon 1 Pro, priced at $2499, is $1000 cheaper than the Verve+ 4S and uses carbon fiber, which is far stronger and more expensive than aluminum.

    <h5 class="font-size-24 mb-font-size-20">Weight and Frame Material</h5>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span
        >The Carbon 1 Pro is 17 lbs lighter than the Verve+ 4S—roughly the weight of a 2-month-old baby or a full 5-gallon water jug. The reduced weight provides a better riding experience, improved handling, and easier transport. This also allows the Carbon 1 Pro’s 352.8Wh battery to achieve a max range of 80 miles, surpassing the 70-mile range of the Verve+ 4S with its larger 500Wh battery. Thanks to its lightweight frame, the Carbon 1 Pro excels in power transmission, responsiveness, and comfort by absorbing vibrations and reducing fatigue.</span

    <h5 class="font-size-24 mb-font-size-20">Power Modes</h5>
    <br>
    <p>
      <span>Urtopia offers 4 customizable assist levels, allowing users to adapt to different needs and riding conditions. This gives the Carbon 1 Pro a range of 43 to 80 miles, ideal for long-distance riders. Due to its heavier weight and higher power consumption, the Verve+ 4S only offers a range of 15 to 70 miles.</span>

        <span>
            Urtopia Carbon 1 Pro charges faster, taking just 2.5 hours, while the Verve+ 4S requires 3.5 to 5 hours for a full charge. This means you can spend more time riding and less time waiting for your bike to recharge.

            The Urtopia Carbon 1 Pro features a large, clear built-in display on the smartbar, providing easy access to information like current speed mode, battery level, speed, cadence, power output, trip distance, calories burned, time, and even the weather for the next hour. In comparison, the Verve+ 4S has a small speedometer on the left handlebar that only displays speed, battery, and power level.

    <h5 class="font-size-24 mb-font-size-20">Anti-theft and Control</h5>
    <br>
    <p>
        <span>
            Urtopia offers a fingerprint reader and app unlock, making it easy to access the bike in any situation. In shutdown mode, Urtopia enters an anti-theft alarm mode, triggering a warning if moved. With its built-in eSIM card, if the bike is stolen, you can track it via GPS. Urtopia boasts a 100% recovery success rate. It also offers multiple ways to control the bike—through the bike's control panel, voice commands, or an app. Urtopia is the first e-bike connected to a GPT chat system, allowing for natural command processing and advanced features. In comparison, the Verve+ 4S lacks these smart enhancements.

        Urtopia’s built-in speaker allows you to play Bluetooth music for a rich audio experience while riding.
